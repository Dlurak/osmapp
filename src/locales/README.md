# Translations

To add a new translation, copy `vocabulary.js` to a new file and change the texts. Some javascript knowledge is needed.

Then add the language to the options menu: `/next.config.js`. Restart your dev server for the changes to take effect. Or wait for deployment on a pull request.

Example: [PR #89](https://github.com/zbycz/osmapp/pull/77/files)
